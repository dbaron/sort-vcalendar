# Sort a vCalendar file by the UID of the events.

# Copyright (c) 2014, L. David Baron <dbaron@dbaron.org>

# This script takes a vCalendar file and sorts any sequence of VEVENT
# sections within it by their UID, with the secondary sort key being
# their SEQUENCE.  The sort should be stable if there are any events
# that have duplicate UID and SEQUENCE, but I haven't tested this
# thoroughly.
#
# I find this script useful for storing backups of a calendar in a
# version control repository, when the calendar is generated in random
# order (as Google Calendar vCalendar files are).
#
# Sorting the events by their UID makes the diffs much smaller, and
# makes them usefully readable.
